# 🏥 Insurance Cost Prediction

This project focuses on predicting individual medical insurance charges using machine learning. The model is trained on demographic and lifestyle data, including age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The goal is to support insurance companies in pricing premiums accurately and managing customer risk effectively.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a dataset of insurance beneficiaries, predict the **medical charges** billed based on features such as:

- Age
- Gender
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Number of children
- Smoking status
- Region of residence

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- GridSearchCV (hyperparameter tuning)

---

## 📈 Models Used

- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

---

## 🧠 Key Findings

- **Random Forest** performed best with the lowest RMSE and highest R².
- **Smoking status**, **age**, and **BMI** were the most influential features.
- Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV** further improved accuracy.
